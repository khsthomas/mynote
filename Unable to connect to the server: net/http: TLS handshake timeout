Just happened to me on a new Windows 10 install with Ubuntu distro in WSL2. I solved the problem by running:

$ sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1350
or for modern Linux distros that deprecated ifconfig:

$ sudo ip link set dev eth0 mtu 1350
(BTW, I was on a VPN connection when trying the 'kubectl get pods' command)

Thanks! I forgot about this! I was using Wireguard on Windows + WSL2. If there is any network problem usually it was MTU issue. –

we had the same issue Windows + WSL2, Over wireguard we decreased the MTU to 1400. Wireguard Server was hosted at cloud provider. –

Changing the MTU did the trick for me. Could you please elaborate on how MTU affects this? –

@Koshur - I haven't debugged this but usually this happens when the "Do-not-fragment" bit is set on a packet that is routed through a network whose MTU is set to a lower number than the packet size. –

It seems that ifconfig is deprecated. This is an alternative command: sudo ip link set dev eth0 mtu 1350 –

Man I spent hours trying to figure it out. I was on VPN and could do everything from Windows, but no matter what I do on WSL it simply could not do anything. Logged in just to upvote and leave a big thank you :) –
